A compatibility list and test playground

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This resource is archived and won't be updated anymore. Vite represents now more than 55% of the npm downloads of Rollup. To properly scale and keep the compat info always up-to-date it makes more sense for Rollup plugins to document their compatibility status directly in their docs.

## Contributing

This is work in progress, there are some official plugins that remain untested. PRs welcomed.

### Adding a Plugin
Start by adding your plugin to `src/plugins` folder. If you'd like your plugin to 
display a test component, then create a new file for it as `YourPlugin.ts`. 
Otherwise you can add it to `OfficalPlugins.ts` if it is an offical plugin or 
`CommunityPlugins.ts` if it is a community plugin.

When writing a plugin make sure you use the `definePlugin` function to define your plugin.

**Example Plugin**
```ts
import { definePlugin, PluginStatus, PluginCategory } from '~/util'
import PluginBeep from '~/components/official/PluginBeep.vue'

export default definePlugin({
  name: 'beep',
  description: 'System beeps on errors and warnings',
  category: PluginCategory.Official,
  status: PluginStatus.Compatible,
  demo: PluginBeep,
})
```
